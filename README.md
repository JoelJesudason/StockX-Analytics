# StockX-Analytics
Applying time series/ML techniques to StockX sneaker data to derive trade insights

*This project was unfortunately abandoned after StockX stopped caching their price chart data. Current code has been left partially complete*


## Current progress:

Run 'python run.py' 
 1. Input URL endpoint of shoe
    - So for "https://stockx.com/air-jordan-1-retro-high-zoom-black-green", provide "air-jordan-1-retro-high-zoom-black-green"
 2. It will show the historic sales chart of the shoe
